A WordPress Plugin to use Sift Ninja to moderate comments
== Description ==
Sift Ninja is a free plugin that provides a powerful yet simple way to automatically moderate and filter comments on your WordPress site by calling powerful Sift API. After installation, any new comments posts on your WordPress site will automatically call the Sift API, where it can be classified as Vulgarity (Profanity) Bullying, Racism, Violence, Sexting, or PII (Personally Identifiable Information
). After the comment has been classified, it will be evaluated by the policy guide that you have configured in the app to determine if the comment should be shown. If the comment fails your policy guide, Sift Ninja gives you the option to either discard the comment automatically or prevent it from being seen while it awaits manual moderation.
User need to create an account at http://www.siftninja.com, a SaaS software application from Two Hat Security Ltd.
== Features ==
Manage Comments
If the submissions for comments on your Wordpress site are abusive or toxic Sift Ninja can automatically identify the topic of the comment, as well as determine the degree of severity for that topic. Using the Wordpress moderation options, you can either get Sift Ninja to send unwanted comments to the trash or to moderation for you to review.
Adjust Filter Sensitivity
You can use the Sift Ninja tuning controls to adjust the sensitivity of the filter to match the scope of what you will and will not allow on your Wordpress comments. For example your blog may deem some profanity in comments to be acceptable, but not tolerate racist remarks in comments. Sift Ninja can be adjusted to moderate comments so those comments comply with your website’s terms of service.
Save Time
Moderating every single comment can be time consuming if your Wordpress site receives a large amount of comments. Sift Ninja can help save time by moderating comments automatically, freeing you up for more important activities.
